# ðŸ§  My Brain

Welcome to my learning repository! Here, I'm documenting everything I'm learning along my development journey. This repository will serve as a space to organize, review, and share knowledge about various technologies, tools, and architectural practices.

## ðŸ“š Contents

In this repository, you'll find notes, code examples, practical projects, and tutorials on the following topics:

- **Java**: Concepts, best practices, design patterns, and frameworks like Spring.
- **NestJS**: Building robust APIs with TypeScript and Node.js.
- **AWS**: Configurations, deployments, and best practices on Amazon's cloud platform.
- **Spring**: Developing Java applications with Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
- **React**: Building modern, dynamic interfaces with React.
- **React Native**: Developing mobile applications using the React philosophy.
- **Angular**: A powerful framework for building robust web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Managing and optimizing relational databases.
- **Quarkus**: A cloud-native Java framework, ideal for microservices.
